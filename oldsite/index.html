                I'm a computer science student at the Georgia Institue
                of Technology. I'm interested in machine learning, software 
                development, and robotics.

            <h2>Indiana Academy Card System</h2>
            <p>
                As a boarding school for high schoolers, the Indiana Academy has basic legal 
                requirements for ensuring the safety of its students Thus, the Academy currently 
                uses a sign-in/sign-out system involving physical cards, about the same size as 
                those "Do Not Disturb" signs at hotels. When leaving the building, students have 
                to filling out these cards, indicating the date, destination, companion, signout 
                time, and expected return time. These cards are then given to the front desk worker, 
                who puts these cards into slots behind the front desk. When signing back into the 
                building, the front desk worker gets the student's card, and fills out the actual 
                sign in time and initials the card. We are designing a digital version of that 
                system, so that the students can fill out the information on a website. The goals 
                are the increase simplicity and reduce time spent at the front desk.

                During the summer before my junior year, I transferred to the Indiana
                Academy for Science, Mathematics, and Humanitites, a two-year boarding
                school on the campus of Ball State University. Here, I took numerous
                AP, dual credit, and BSU classes.

            <h2>Center Grove High School</h2>
            <p>
                I spent my first two years of high school at Center Grove High Schoo.
                Here, I took part in a number of AP classes, the Project Lead The Way
                engineering program, and the high school swim team, on which I set a
                school record and became a state finalist.
